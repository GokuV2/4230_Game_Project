# Scourge of the Godari
Ever wanted to play 2D platformer which is more skill-based than others out there. Look no where. You are thrown into a world of slimes
and bones. Your goal is to collect all the gems present in the world and exit through the shiny door. The game consists of 3 levels, each
tougher than the previous. Each level prepares you for the boss that awaits you at the end. Can you beat him and free yourself?
